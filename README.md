### Notes

The purpose of this final project is to take my previous work and turn it into a fully working CRUD application. 

I still have much to learn with regard to my work in JavaScript and jQuery, and this deploy is reflective of that. This deploy (9bc3b1) continued some clean up to the CSS, in particular matching fonts with the particular XD prototype and fitting the particular page responsiveness requirements of this assignment.

It should be noted that there continue to be snippets of CSS that will later set this app up to be fully responsive for all display types. For this particular project, the site needs to be fully responsive to 1024 x 768. Sizing the brower smaller than that will review a hamburger menu for mobile deployment, but the styling is still in various stages of development. A sizing smaller than 1024 x 768 is outside the scope of this particular project.

The login-logout page is now fully functional, creating a unique user ID when a new user signs up, allowing the app to retrive information specific to that user.

The CRUD application is certainly in the gamma stages of development (perhaps later!) as I need to spend continued time thinking through the organization of my JavaScript and jQuery code, which is available for review in the app.js file. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I was not able to get the application to be fully functional at this time. This is my continued goal for this application, as I hope to develop it into something for my personal use! I hope that all who look at this project can assess the work that I have done to this point, understanding that there is much more to do, as is always the case for any application.
